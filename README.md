# cpsc222-final-project
I used two sources for the data in this project: Sleep Cycle and Apple Health. The Sleep Cycle data is contained in sleepdata.csv
and contains information on how long I slept, when I woke up and fell asleep, the quality of the sleep, and the date. The Apple Health
data was originally originally in a XML file; I used an online file converter to get it into a csv file which is called stepcount.csv
in this repository. It contains information on the amount of steps I took each day. The project is in project.ipynb. Make sure to go through
and run each code block in order if it isn't working.

To use this just put your sleep data into sleepdata.csv and the Apple Health data into stepcount.csv, then go through and run all the code blocks in project.ipynb.
